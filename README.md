A Basic Compiler/Interpreter for a Custom Programming Language

## Project Description

This project implements a basic compiler/interpreter for a custom programming language, focusing on tokenization, parsing, and evaluation phases. The project defines a syntax tree structure, a lexer to tokenize source code, a parser to build an abstract syntax tree (AST), and an interpreter to evaluate the AST, supporting common language constructs such as declarations, assignments, binary expressions, and object literals.

### Key Components

1. **Lexer**: A lexical analyzer that reads source code and breaks it down into tokens. The lexer recognizes literals (numbers, identifiers), keywords (`let`, `const`), operators (`=`, `+`, `-`, etc.), and delimiters (`;`, `,`, `{}`, `[]`).

2. **Parser**: A recursive descent parser that reads tokens generated by the lexer and organizes them into an abstract syntax tree (AST). This tree includes various node types, such as `Program`, `Declaration`, `Assignment`, `BinaryExpression`, `ObjectLiteral`, and others.

3. **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**: A hierarchical structure representing the source code syntax. Each node corresponds to a specific language construct, such as expressions, statements, or literals.

4. **Interpreter**: Executes the AST by evaluating each node. The interpreter handles variable declarations, assignments, and binary expressions and performs object manipulation.

5. **Environment**: Manages variable scope and stores values of declared variables, handling nested scopes to support local and global variable management.

### Features

- **Variable Declaration and Assignment**: Supports `let` and `const` declarations, with assignment expressions.
- **Expressions**: Implements binary operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), object literals, and member access.
